### Game-like Challenges (Why are they fun?)
1. Clear, achievable goal with a tangible result
2. Contraints (rules)
(3.) Open Ended
(4.) Full Participation
(5.) Success orientation-likely to succeed. no chance of failure but degrees of success.
It is possible to make almost any exercise into a game by using constraints.
Ex. time limit "3 minutes and dont start until I say go" or "make present perfect sentences but dont use the letter L"

#### Games
- Say things about a picture
- Guessing games
- Reverse guessing (whole class knows the answer and only one doesn't)

#### Presentations
- Longer Stretch of Discourse
- Presentated by one person
- Prepared and rehearesed
- Uusally for more advanced classes

Examples include (from low to high level):
- Show and tell
- personal anectdote
- joke
- research project
- a narrative
- a review of a book/movie
- a commercial/political promotion
- academic research talk

### Questions
1. Should I interrupt to correct speaking?
Not necessarily so. Sometimes it may be important to correct. We want students to speak a lot so we don't want to overdo it but never say never.
Correction may hinder fluency, disturb or distract.
But, the mistake may be reinforced if not corrected. There is some evidence that students want to be corrected.
Depends on:
- The aims of the course.
- The expectations of the students and their preferences.
- The importance and persistence of the mistake.
- The confidence of the student.
- The exictement value of the student.
- and so on.
As for recasts...? Research shows that usually they don't notice. If you're going to interrupt to correct do it in a way that they will notice. Is it or is it not important?

2. How can I stop students lapsing into L1?
- If they speak L1 here and there it isn't a disaster. She sometimes justifies group work
- If they speak English 75% of the time--that's a success.
Things that can help:
- Make sure the task is well within their level (reduces temptation to use the native language)
- Include "speaking lots of English" as part of the task
- Share with them the importance of keeping to English. 
- Appoint 'monitors'. One person each group whose job it is to remind people to speak English
- Include Assessment.

3. How often should I do these kinds of activities (games, presentaitons, etc.)?
- It depends on the context. She does it about once a week in her context.

4. Should there be some kind of written feedback?
- Not usually.

5. Where can I find more ideas?
- See powerpoint

##3 Secrets of Communication
###Gary Schmidt, Toastmasters International
###1. Building Personal Relationships
The speaker had two major things in common with a person: star wars and toastmasters.
Took a photo of him, put it on facebook, someone commented and he found a job.
Not what can this person do for me, but just create the relationship.
Don't look at it as a transaction.
###2. Communication--How do you empower them as a communicator?
Engage everyone to have a stake in your decisions.
###3. Be a servant-leader
If you focus entirely on the goals and dreams of other people, it will always come back to help you get what you want.

Drink warm water before speaking to loosen up your throat.
