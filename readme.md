##3 Secrets of Communication
###Gary Schmidt, Toastmasters International
###1. Building Personal Relationships
The speaker had two major things in common with a person: star wars and toastmasters.
Took a photo of him, put it on facebook, someone commented and he found a job.
Not what can this person do for me, but just create the relationship.
Don't look at it as a transaction.
###2. Communication--How do you empower them as a communicator?
Engage everyone to have a stake in your decisions.
###3. Be a servant-leader
If you focus entirely on the goals and dreams of other people, it will always come back to help you get what you want.

Drink warm water before speaking to loosen up your throat.
